Create a Spotify playlist of all the songs by artists related to an artist, to a
specific depth.

Given an artist name, they're located in Spotify.
The artists who will comprise the playlist are gathered by walking the tree of
related artists. The depth is configurable, but I wouldn't recommend setting it
higher than 3, as you'll start getting an incredible amount of results, many of
which only have the slightest connection to the seed artist.
All tracks from all albums available in the given country are then added to a
new playlist, titled "<artist name> - Related Artists". If no country code is
provided, then the album will be included even if it's not available in your
country.

Note that Spotipy requires that you have the following 3 environment variables
set: SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, and SPOTIPY_REDIRECT_URI. The
client ID and secret can be obtained by registering the application with Spotify
by going to https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/. The redirect URI
doesn't have to be a real site, as long as it looks like a URI. For example,
"http://localhost" is an acceptable value.
