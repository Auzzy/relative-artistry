Create a Spotify playlist of all the songs by artists related to an artist, to a specific level.

Given an artist name, they're located in Spotify.
The artists who will comprise the playlist are gathered by walking the tree of relatde artists. The depth is configurable, but I wouldn't recommend setting it higher than 3, as you'll start getting an incredible amount of results, many of which only have the slightest connection to the seed artist.
All tracks from all albums available in the given country are then added to a new playlist, titled "<artist name> - Related Artists". If no country code is provided, then the album will be included even if it's not available in your country.
